    "Last week we considered a cost function for minimization of the error. We considered items (films) and users and assumed that each movie rating, $y_{i,j}$ could be summarised by an inner product between a vector associated with the item, $\\mathbf{v}_j$ and one associated with the user $\n",
    "\\mathbf{u}_i$. We justified the inner product as a measure of similarity in the space of 'movie subjects', where both the users and the items lived, giving the analogy of a library.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make predictions we encouraged the similarity to be high if the movie rating was high using the quadratic error function,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_{i,j}(\\mathbf{u}_i, \\mathbf{v}_j) = \\left(\\mathbf{u}_i^\\top \\mathbf{v}_j - y_{i,j}\\right)^2,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "which we then summed across all the observations to form the total error\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E(\\mathbf{U}, \\mathbf{V}) = \\sum_{i,j}s_{i,j}\\left(\\mathbf{u}_i^\\top \\mathbf{v}_j - y_{i,j}\\right)^2,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $s_{i,j}$ is an indicator variable which is set to 1 if the rating of movie $j$ by user $i$ is provided in our data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is known as a sum of squares error. Minimizing it was first proposed by [Legendre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrien-Marie_Legendre) in 1805. His book, which was on the orbit of comets, is available on google books, we can take a look at the relevant page by calling the code below. "

    "### Coordinate Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "In the movie recommender system example, we minimised the objective function by steepest descent based gradient methods. Our updates required us to compute the gradient at the position we were located, then to update the gradient according to the direction of steepest descent. This time, we will take another approach. It is known as *coordinate descent*. In coordinate descent, we choose to move one parameter at a time. Ideally, we design an algorithm that at each step moves the parameter to its minimum value. At each step we choose to move the individual parameter to its minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the minimum, we look for the point in the curve where the gradient is zero. This can be found by taking the gradient of $E(m,c)$ with respect to the parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Update for Offset\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the parameter $c$ first. The gradient goes nicely through the summation operator, and we obtain\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\text{d}E(m,c)}{\\text{d}c} = -\\sum_{i=1}^n 2(y_i-mx_i-c).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Now we want the point that is a minimum. A minimum is an example of a [*stationary point*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_point), the stationary points are those points of the function where the gradient is zero. They are found by solving the equation for $\\frac{\\text{d}E(m,c)}{\\text{d}c} = 0$. Substituting in to our gradient, we can obtain the following equation, \n",
    "$$\n",
    "0 = -\\sum_{i=1}^n 2(y_i-mx_i-c)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "which can be reorganised as follows,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "c^* = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-m^*x_i)}{n}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The fact that the stationary point is easily extracted in this manner implies that the solution is *unique*. There is only one stationary point for this system. Traditionally when trying to determine the type of stationary point we have encountered we now compute the *second derivative*,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\text{d}^2E(m,c)}{\\text{d}c^2} = 2n.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The second derivative is positive, which in turn implies that we have found a minimum of the function. This means that setting $c$ in this way will take us to the lowest point along that axes."

    "$$E(m, c) =  \\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-mx_i-c)^2$$\n",

    "We can simplify the above further:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$-\\sum_{i=1}^n 2(y_i-mx_i-c)*x_i = -2\\sum_{i=1}^n ((y_i-c)*x_i -mx_i^2)$$\n",

    "To get the above update function for $m^*$, we need to equate the above to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\text{d}E(m, c)}{\\text{d}m} = 0 \\Rightarrow -2\\sum_{i=1}^n ((y_i-c)*x_i -mx_i^2) = 0 \\Rightarrow \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-c)*x_i - \\sum_{i=1}^n mx_i^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-c)*x_i = \\sum_{i=1}^n mx_i^2 \\Rightarrow m = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-c)*x_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}$$\n",

A [QR-decomposition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition) of a matrix factorises it into a matrix which is an orthogonal matrix $\\mathbf{Q}$, so that $\\mathbf{Q}^\\top \\mathbf{Q} = \\mathbf{I}$. And a matrix which is upper triangular, $\\mathbf{R}$. \n",
